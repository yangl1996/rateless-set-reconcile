The plotting scripts plot all data files in the directory, one curve per
file. The curve title is the prefix of the filename, ending at (not incl.)
the first dash.

For example, to explore how coding threshold affects the decoding
performance, run a series of experiments with

./decode-exp -t 1 -out t=1
./decode-exp -t 2 -out t=2
./decode-exp -t 3 -out t=3

Then, run the plotting script. The output plot will contain three
curves: t=1, t=2, t=3, plus plot-specific curves such as the theoretical
optimum.
