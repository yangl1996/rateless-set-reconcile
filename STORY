Idea 1: encode among transactions, so that most codewords contain "novel" information.
    - Sliding window rateless code.
    - Degree and transaction selection.
    - Numerical analysis.

Idea 2: specify which transactions are in a codeword without excessive metadata use.
    - Timing estimation.
    - Hash range.
    - Bloom filter and short hashes.
    - Enumeration, checksum, and signature.
